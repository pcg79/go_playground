// A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

// Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

// Two ways to do this.

// 1) Start w/ two numbers - 999 and 999.  Work down finding numbers that are palindromes.  Cons: that's a lot of multiplying.

// 2) Start at the max number made by multiplying 2 3 digit numbers (999*999 = 998001) and work down to min number made by multiplying 2 3 digit numbers (100*100 = 10000).  Stop when you get a palindrome, then see if it can be made by multiplying 2 3 digit numbers.

// 998001 down to 10000 do |x|

// if x is a palindrome
//   999 down to 100 do |i|
//     return "winner is x" if x mod i is a three digit number.


// is palindrome (x)
//   str = x to str

//   first part = str[0..2]
//   second part = str[3..5]
//   second part = flip second part around.

//   return true if first part = second part
